    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A fast and simple way to make poached eggs.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs (as many as desired and will fit in pot)</li>
        <li>Water (as much as needed to cover eggs in pot)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)
    </ul>
    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pot (to fit eggs)</li>
        <li>Slotted spoon (or other way of straining water from eggs)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill the pot with water and add the desired amount of salt</li>
        <li>Heat water to the point when bubbles start rising in the pot</li>
        <li>At the point when bubbles start rising, use the slotted spoon to swirl
            the water in a circle such that it swirls on its own when you stop</li>
        <li>While the water swirls, crack an egg into the center of the swirling
            water so that it remains in the middle. Repeat until you have no eggs
            remaining to be poached.</li>
        <li>Set the stove to a medium setting.</li>
        <li>When a white foam reaches the brim of the pot, turn off the stove.</li>
        <li>Watch the eggs and lightly feel them with the slotted spoon until they
            reach the desired texture.</li>
        <li>Scoop out the solid egg(s) (as opposed to the foam) and serve onto
            a plate</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
